            <Label textWrap="true" text="Three years ago, I wrote the FocusBlocker to help me focus on my master thesis. It’s basically a website blocker that stops me from checking Facebook every five minute. But is different from other blockers like LeechBlock that requires you to set a fixed schedule. FocusBlocker lets you set a quota, e.g. I can browse 10 minutes of Facebook then block it for 50 minutes. So as long as you have remaining quota, you can check Facebook anytime. I’m glad that other people find it useful, and I even got my first donation through AMO because of happy users."></Label>
            <Label textWrap="true" text="Since this extension serves my need, I’m not actively maintaining it or adding new features. But I was aware of Firefox’s transition from the legacy Add-on SDK to WebExtension API. So before WebExtension API is fully available, I started to migrate it to Chrome’s extension format. But I didn’t got the time to actually migrate it back to Firefox, until a user emails me asking for a WebExtension version. I looked into the statistics, the daily active user count drops from ~1000 to ~300. That’s when I rolled up my sleeve and actually migrated it in one day. Here is how I did it and what I’ve learned from the process."></Label>
            <Label textWrap="true" text="There is one more modification need. In my Chrome extension I used the old options_page setting setting to set the preference page. But Firefox only support the newer options_ui. You can also apply browser’s system style for your settings page, so the UI looks like part of the Firefox setting. Firefox generalized the name from chrome_style to browser_style. So this is what I need to add to my manifest.json file (and remove the options_page setting)."></Label>
